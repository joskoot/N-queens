procedure: (queens N [show-solutions? whole-classes? show-boards?])
           -> (list/c natural? natural? natural? (listof n*s))

   N               : natural?
   show-solutions? : any/c = #t
   whole-classes?  : any/c = #t
   show-boards?    : any/c = #t

Computes all solutions of the N-queens problem on an NxN board and shows the number of solutions and
the number of symmetrically distinct solutions.

If optional argument show-solutions? is #f, no solutions are shown and the other two optional
arguments are ignored. If show-solutions? is not #f, and arguments whole-classes? is #f,
one solution of every class of symmetrically equivalent solutions is shown.
If both show-solutions? and whole-classes? have true value, all solutions are shown.
If show-boards? is not #f, solutions are shown as pictures, otherwise they are shown as lists.

A rank is a row of the board. A file is a column of the board.
Ranks are identified by the numbers 0 up to but not including N.
Usually files are named 'a', 'b', 'c', etc.
However, it is easier to identify the files by the numbers 0 up to but not including N.
As far as applicable, solutions are sorted according to the order of their class of symmetrical
equivalence. Within each class the solutions are sorted according to their representation.
In every solution every rank and every file contains exactly one queen.
Therefore a solution can be written as:

   ([rank 0] .. [rank N-1])

the i-th element showing which rank in file i contains the queen.
Reversal of this list corresponds to reflection in the centerline parallel to the files.
The list can also be read as:

   ([file 0] .. [file N-1])

the i-th element showing which file in rank i contains the queen.
The difference between these two interpretations corresponds to
a reflection in the diagonal from field (0 0) to field (N-1 N-1).
Reversal of this list corresponds to reflection in the centerline parellel to the ranks.

For N=0 and N=1 there is one solution with all symmetries of a square.
For N=2 and N=3 there are no solutions.
For N≥4 there always is more than one solution and the following list is returned:

   (N nr-of-solutions nr-of-classes (n*s ...))

where s is 2, 4 or 8 and n*s indicates that there are n classes of size s.
A class is a set of distinct but symmetrically equivalent solutions.
(+ n ...) always equals the number of all classes.
(+ (* n s) ...) always is the total number of solutions.
The returned data are printed too.

A square has 8 symmetries. Consider the square:

   3 ―――― 2
   │      │
   │      │
   0 ―――― 1

The symmetries are:

       v →  0  1  2  3
            ――――――――――
     E(v)   0  1  2  3   identity
     R(v)   1  2  3  0   clockwise rotation over 90°
    R2(v)   2  3  0  1   clockwise rotation over 180° (for the square the same as inversion)
    R3(v)   3  0  1  2   clockwise rotation over 270°
    Sv(v)   1  0  3  2   reflection in vertical centerline
    Sh(v)   3  2  1  0   reflection in horizontal centerline
   Sd1(v)   0  3  2  1   reflection in diagonal 0-2
   Sd2(v)   2  1  0  3   reflection in diagonal 1-3
            ――――――――――

The symmetries form a group, named C4v in the nomenclature of Schoenflies, 4.m in the nomenclature of
Shubnikov and 4mm in the International nomenclature.
The table of composition is (modulo permutation of the rows and/or the colums)

   E   R   R2  R3  Sh  Sd1 Sv  Sd2
   R   R2  R3  E   Sd1 Sv  Sd2 Sh
   R2  R3  E   R   Sv  Sd2 Sh  Sd1
   R3  E   R   R2  Sd2 Sh  Sd1 Sv
   Sh  Sd2 Sv  Sd1 E   R3  R2  R
   Sd1 Sh  Sd2 Sv  R   E   R3  R2
   Sv  Sd1 Sh  Sd2 R2  R   E   R3
   Sd2 Sv  Sd1 Sh  R3  R2  R   E

Each element is the composition of the element in the left column with that in the upper row,
the left column and upper row included (because E·s=s for every element s).
Notice that the composition is not abelean. For example R·Sd1=Sv and Sd1·R=Sh.
The group can be formed from a base of two elements only. The minimal bases are:

   {R  Sh }
   {R  Sv }
   {R  Sd1}
   {R  Sd2}
   {R3 Sh }
   {R3 Sv }
   {R3 Sd1}
   {R3 Sd2}
   {Sh Sd1}
   {Sh Sd2}
   {Sv Sd1}
   {Sv Sd2}

In the program a base of three elements is used: Sv, Sh and Sd1.
This is done because Sv and Sh are fast functions and R2=Sh·Sv.
All other elements are made by composition with Sd1, which is slower.

   R   = Sv·Sd1
   R2  = Sh·Sv
   R3  = Sh·Sd1
   Sd2 = R2·Sd1 = Sh·Sv·Sd1

For N≥4 a reflection always produces a distinct solution, but not every reflection necessarily yields
a distinct solution. For example, applied to a solution that is invariant under rotation through 90°,
every reflection yields the same solution. Id est, If R(s)=s, then Sv(s)=Sh(s)=Sd1(s)=Sd2(s).

For N=0 there is one solution with all symmetries (no queen at all on an empty board)
For N=1 there is one solution with all symmetries (one queen on the single field of the board)
For N=2 there is no solution.
For N=3 there is no solution.

For N≥4 there always is more than one solution. A solution s1 is symmetrically equivalent with
solution s2 if s2 can be obtained from s1 by applying a symmetry operation to s1.
This defines an equivalence relation.
A solution for N≥4 cannot have a reflection symmetry, because every rank, everyfile and
every diagonal can contain one queen only. Remain the following three possibilities:

   Solution s has symmetry R.
   This implies E(s)=R(s)=R2(s)=R3(s).
   Hence a rotation does not alter the solution.
   There are 2 equivalent but distinct solutions,
   which can be obtained one from the other by an arbitrary reflection,
   but with R(s)=E(s) we have Sv(s)=Sh(s)=Sd1(s)=Sd2(s)
   meaning that every reflection produces the same solution.
   
   Solution s has symmetries E and R2 only.
   There are 4 equivalent but distinct solutions,
   which can be obtained one from another by R-odd,
   a reflection or an R-odd combined with a reflection,
   where R-odd is R or R3.
   With R2(s)=E(s), we also have R3(s)=R(s), Sh(s)=Sv(s) and Sd1(s)=Sd2(s).

   Solution s has symmetry E only.
   In common language no symmetry at all.
   There are 8 equivalent but distinct solutions.
   Given a solution s, every symmetry operation p yields a distinct solution p(s),
   E(s) being equal to s, of course.

Hence, for N≥4, a class of equivalent solutions consists of 2, 4 or 8 distinct solutions
and the total number of solutions is even.
